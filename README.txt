This was a paired programming project for the HackerYou bootcamp.  
We were tasked with creating a web application using JavaScript/jQuery and an API of our choice.  
We chose to use the Etsy API to build a gift generator app called Giftify.  The user is able to specify who they are shopping for (male/female/both)
and what category of item they are shopping for.  This was my first time forking on Git and using an upstream for collaborative coding.
